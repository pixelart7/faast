!! EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT ONLY - NOT SAFE FOR PRODUCTION !!

My take on doing a simple function-as-a-service system. It allow user to add and edit function via UI, and allow user to call that function easily.

The function can be written in JS using Node as the environment.

## Instruction

1. Has Node v.10+, Yarn and PM2 installed
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn run start` using pm2
4. Access via `http://localhost:3000/ui`
